# Background
As a seasoned Software Engineer with 6 years of experience, I have a proven track record of successfully working with multiple companies and clients. <p>I possess expertise in various areas of software development, including API integration, automation, release management, and system architecture.</p>

I have had the opportunity to work on a range of projects that have helped to streamline and automate key business processes. One of my primary responsibilities has been to work with external partners and clients who consume our APIs for bill payment services. This has required me to collaborate closely with stakeholders to understand their unique requirements and help them to integrate our systems with theirs. 

Through this work, I have developed a strong understanding of how to design and implement APIs that are reliable, secure, and scalable.
My strong foundation in software engineering principles and practices, coupled with my ability to quickly grasp new concepts and technologies, allows me to adapt easily to different programming languages.

I have successfully applied this skill in various projects throughout my career. For instance, I have worked on projects that required me to use programming languages such as Node.JS, Golang, and Python. While I may not have had extensive experience with some of these languages, I was able to quickly learn and apply them to achieve project goals.

My ability to work with different programming languages has also helped me to become a versatile software engineer. I can easily switch between different technologies and adapt to new requirements, which allows me to contribute effectively to a wide range of projects.
